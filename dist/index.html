                                <p>Backcourt Dribble began as a passion project for a Dev Bootcamp cohortmate, Denise Duffy, who reached out seeking help to bring her vision to life. This on-going venture began in February of 2018 and was a runner-up winner at the U.S. Soccer Hackathon in Chicago in July 2018. As the lead developer, I have touched every aspect of this project and worked throughout the tech stack. Additionally, I have assisted in developing the business model, generating ideas for features, and site design.</p>
                                <p>Backcourt Dribble is a platform to boost fan engagement across women’s sports. Users can predict the outcome of matches and earn points for correct predictions, view leaderboards and personal score boards to compare their ranking against other users, engage with various relevant twitter integrations, and shop player-hosted experiences. </p>

                                <p>In the summer of 2017, I googled Maitland Mountain Farm after buying some of their products at the local Farmer’s Market only to find that they did not have an online presence outside of Facebook. I was well acquainted with the owner and after accepting part-time work helping them make pickles, I proposed that I build their website and consequently landed my first paid freelance gig! Over the course of the next several months, we worked together to craft a site that showcased their products, their passion, and their family.</p>
                                <p>Maitland Mountain Farm is an urban farm and pickling company based in Salem, MA. The site allows users to learn about the farm and their pickled goods. Visitors can also learn more about where to buy their products, and read about the farm’s recent features in the media.</p>

                                <p>In January of 2018 I began working full-time as a cider maker at Far From the Tree, a craft hard cider company in Salem, MA. Having been trained as a Biologist, I was quick to point out the importance of collecting data and maintaining records throughout the product lifecycle. I built the laboratory program and began tracking cider data using google sheets and charts. After several months, the workflow and querying became cumbersome. I researched affordable software and couldn’t find anything that would fit our operation so I decided to build it myself. </p>
                                <p>Core is an app for collecting, maintaining, and analyzing data associated hard cider production on a small scale. This tool is particularly useful for craft cider houses or hobbyists who may not be able to afford other costly, commercial-scale software. It is also useful for those interested in tracking various laboratory functions typically involved in the fermentation and stabilization processes. A user can record data to track the fermentation process from start to finish, schedule experiments, and view analytics.</p>

                                <p>If you have ever been to a beach in New England in July, you will understand how valuable a resource this platform is. Greenheads are biting flies produced in coastal marshes and appear en mass for several weeks each summer. These flies are extremely difficult to repel and often result in a significant loss of revenue for recreational areas, as the flies cause a decline in visitor attendance. Additionally, many people have severe allergic reactions to the bite of the flies. As an avid beach goer, I have been disappointed in my search of a service that will alert me if flies have been spotted in my area. </p>
                                <p>Swat is platform that uses crowd-sourced information to track green-head fly sightings on the coast of Massachusetts. A user will be able to log on to the app, select a beach, wetland, or park in Massachusetts, drop a pin, and add comments about the location and severity of the fly population.</p>

                                <p>CodeConnect was the brain child of Dev Bootcamp students who were nearing the completion of the program. Bootcamps are emerging as a popular and effective way to become a developer and we wanted to create a space that could connect potential employers seeking diverse and unique talent to graduates. As the capstone project at Dev Bootcamp, the team was given seven days to bring this concept to life. I worked as a full-stack developer on this project and served as the point person for solving interpersonal issues among team members.</p>
                                <p>CodeConnect is a job board for bootcamp graduates. A recent grad can log on and search for contracted employers seeking help in their region. Graduates have a profile and can upload their resumes, track their profile views, and keep in touch with cohort mates post-graduation with an in-app messaging system. Employers can search for candidates through the app.</p>

                                <p>This project was built while taking "The Web Developer Bootcamp" offered by Udemy and taught by Colt Steele. At the time my experience was primarily in the backend and I lacked understanding of color theory and was largely unaware of the different types of color values used in CSS (I had primarily been using Hex Codes and color pickers). Building this game allowed me to explore a different means of working with color and understand the benefits of using different color declarations.</p>
                                <p>The RGB Color Game is a memory game built to help users become familiar with RGB color values.  The game is initialized with a grid of colored tiles, one of which is selected as the target or "winning" color. The RGB value of said color is displayed at the top of the page. The user's goal is to match the corresponding colored tile to the RGB value.</p>
